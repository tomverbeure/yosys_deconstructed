# A Walk through the Yosys Synthesis Flow

## Introduction

Not too long ago, the only way to play with RTL synthesis, mapping a digital design from Verilog or VHDL to gates, was forced 
to use commercial tools. Some of them were incredibly expensive (think Synopsys Design Compiler), so of them were free, as in
beer, and included in commercial FPGA synthesis packages. None of them were open source.

Yosys changed all that. 


Yosys comes with an extensive 194 page manual that describes the internal architecture and data structures, as well as all
the different commands that are supported.

It's required reading if you want to understand the full scope of the software, but it's more of a reference manual that
describes command in isolation.

What's lacking is a story that walks a reader from input, RTL, through all the steps towards the output, a
gate-level netlist that can be used by the target place and route tool.

This blog post is the result of wanting to understand these different steps. By writing things down for public consumption,
I force myself to dig deeper to avoid major mistake. I hope other will benefit from it as well.

## The Lattice iCE40 FPGA from Verilog to Bitstream

Lattice iCE40 FPGAs were the first FPGAs for which the bitstream has been fully reverse engineered. This has enabled
the creation of project icestorm, an end-to-end design flow from Verilog RTL to a functional bitstream.

Yosys handles the translation from Verilog to cells from the ICE40 primitives library. [Arachne P&R](XXX) or [next-pnr](XXX)
take it from there and places and routes all the cells and wires. Finally, [icestorm](XXX) converts the placed database
and converts it to a bitstream.

A good example of the whole flow can be seen in [this project] that maps a Verilog design to an ICE40 on a BlackIce-II
FPGA board.

## Yosys and the ICE40 FPGA

Synthesizing a design with Yosys for the ICE40 couldn't be easier. It consists of the 
following commands:

```
read_verilog my_design.v
synth_ice40
write_verilog my_design.syn.v
```

That's it!

The `synth_ice40` command is essentially a script that's embedded in the Yosys C++ code. It calls many lower level Yosys commands.
And while the command has plenty of options, in this blog post I'll walk through the default flow in which no additional options are specified.

You can find the code of the `synth_ice40` command [here](XXX). When you assume all the defaults, the code can be reduced to
the following sequence of commands:

```
begin:
	read_verilog -lib -D_ABC +/ice40/cells_sim.v
	hierarchy -check -auto-top
	proc

flatten:
	flatten
	tribuf -logic
	deminout

The `synth_ice40` command is split up into multiple phases. With the `-run <from_label:to_label>` parameter, you
can restrict the command to execute only those phases that you're interested in. 

We're not interested in doing that, but it serves as a good documentation that helps understanding which higher 
level steps are performed to get from initial RTL code to final gates.

Let's walk through the whole process!

## Before We Start

If you want to get a deeper understanding of Yosys, you should read the manual.

To get a quick idea about what a Yosys command does, you also just fire it up, and type 'help <command>'.

Location of the source code is [here](...).

We will use 'write_ilang ...' a various steps of the process

## Loading the Whole Design

Before calling `synth_ice40`, you need a design to synthesize. To do that, you can use one
of the many Yosys design front-ends. The most common one is the Verilog language front-end.

```
read_verilog my_design.v
```

Reading in the Verilog kicks off a complex process that parses the Verilog, and converts it to an abstract syntax tree (AST).
It already resolves some functions, splits the design into sequential and combinatorial statements etc.

Finally, it generates an RTLIL (RTL Intermediate Language) representation of the design: the core representation used by 
Yosys as input and as output of all the different passes. 

Various Verilog operators and function have been transformed into functional cells such as `$add`, `$mul`, `$shift`, `$logic_not`, 
`$reduce_and`, `$concat`, `$memrd`, `$memwr`, and many more. (See [rtlil.cc](XXX))

At any point in time, it's possible to export the RTLIL representation to a file. It's also possible to read in such files
with the RTLIL front-end.

While the `read_verilog` command can understand virtually all synthesizable Verilog constructs, it's important to know that
it is extremely liberal in the way it parses Verilog. That is: it will freely read Verilog that wouldn't compile correctly 
with common Verilog simulators.

One should always do some sanity checks on the design by simulating it, or by running it through some linting tool (e.g.
by running Verilator in linting mode.)

The result for `read_verilog` is a loose collection of design modules on which no consistency checking has been performed.
For example, if one module instantiates a submodule and connects a port that doesn't exist on the submodule, no error
will be report. This will happen later in the process...

# "begin": Loading and Checking the Whole Design

```
begin:
	read_verilog -lib -D_ABC +/ice40/cells_sim.v
	...
```


It's very common for a design to instantiate FPGA-specific functional blocks such as PLLs, IO pads, memories, DSPs and more.

The definition of these primitives can be found in some kind of library file. 

There are often different file types for the same library. Most common is a Verilog simulation model and a Liberty (.lib) file 
for synthesis.

In addition, different library files can be used during different stages of the process: when reading in the whole design,
the cell library may contain all FPGA primitives that can be instantiated in the FPGA, including those that can't be
automatically instantiated during techmapping (the process of converting the logic onto FPGA specific primitives.) The
mapping library will then only contain those cells that should be used during the techmapping phase.

In this case, we are reading the `cells_sim.v` file. It contains cells that are compatible with the SiliconBlue cell library.
SiliconBlue Technologies was a startup that was specialized on low power FPGAs.Lattice Semiconductor acquired them in
2011 and transformed their technology into the Lattice iCE40 FPGA product line.

Some of the `cells_sim.v` are blackboxes that map directly to a hard cell in the FPGA for which there isn't even
simulation behavior: PLLs, oscillators, RGB LED driver, I2C and SPI unit, ... They are annotated with the `(* blackbox *)`
Verilog attribute, which instructs Yosys to ignore these modules going forward and just keep them as-is during the
coming processing passes.

Most of the cells, however, have a simulation model attached to them, allowing the designer to verify a design with special cells
in simulation as well.

However, in this case, the simulation model doesn't matter: `read_verilog` gets called with the `-lib` parameter. This 
tells Yosys to treat all modules in the Verilog file as black boxes except those that explicitly have the attribute 
`whitebox` or `lib_whitebox`.

```
begin:
	...
	hierarchy -check -auto-top
	...
```

When instantiating Verilog module, you can often specify module parameters. These parameters can influence the
way the RTL operates. A good example can be seen below:

<XXX>

When the same module is instantiated in the design multiple times with different parameter values, the hierarchy
command will create unique versions of these modules, one for each unique set of parameters.

You can see this here in the RTLIL version of the module:

<XXX>

The optional `-check` parameter will verify that the design is now complete: all modules are defined, either as an RTL
design, or as a black box.

Finally, the `-auto-top` option will identify which module of the design is the top-level module. A top-level module is
a module that is not instantiated in any other module. When there are multiple top-level modules (which really
doesn't happen), Yosys uses a score based heuristic and selects the one with the highest score.

```
begin:
	...
	proc
```

The final of importing a new design is the first one in a long series of RTLIL transformation steps. 

After reading in Verilog, the RTLIL still contains higher level object called a `RTLIL:Process`. These contain
sub-objects related to case statements, flip-flops with resets, initialization values etc.

The `proc` statement goes through a number of sub-steps that replace all these concepts into multiplexers, 
flip-flops, and latches. It also identifies asynchronous resets, and removes dead code.

# Flatten

```
flatten:
	flatten
	tribuf -logic
	deminout
```

Right now, our design database is still fully hierarchical. Now is the time to remove all that hierachy into one
flat blob of logic and cells. Modules with the `blackbox` attribute aren't touched. (It's possible to apply different
synthesis recipes to different parts of your design. One way to do this is to manually attach the `blackbox` attribute
to a submodule if you don't want to it be touched.)

The `tribuf` command converts $mux cells with a 'z' input into tristate buffers. This makes it possible to 
instantiate tristate output pads in a design in a generic way, without explicitly instantiating a technology-specific
tristate capable IO pad. The '-logic` option converts internal-only tri-state buffers into regular logic: internal
tri-state buffers were once common in ASICs, but have disappeared by the end of the nineties.

Finally, the `deminout` command goes over all inout ports and replaces them by input-only or output-only ports
